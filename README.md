# Keylogger Discord Bot

## Overview

This Python script is a basic keylogger that captures keystrokes, takes screenshots, and sends the collected data to a Discord channel via a webhook. The script uses the `pynput` library for keyboard monitoring and `pygetwindow` along with `pyautogui` for capturing screenshots.

**Disclaimer:** This script is intended for educational purposes only. The use of keyloggers on individuals without their explicit consent is unethical and may violate laws. Be aware of legal and ethical considerations before using or modifying this script.

## Setup

1.  **Discord Webhook:**
    
    -   Insert your Discord webhook URL in the `WEBHOOK_URL` variable.
2.  **Log File:**
    
    -   You can rename the `LOG_FILE_PATH` variable to customize the name of the log file.
3.  **Dependencies:**
    
    -   Install required dependencies using `pip install pynput pygetwindow pyautogui`.

## Usage

Run the script to start the keylogging service. The script will capture keystrokes, take screenshots, and send periodic reports to the specified Discord channel.

## Discord Bot Integration (Future Enhancement)

This script can be extended to function as a Discord bot that can be controlled through Discord commands. To implement this:

1.  Add a Discord bot token to the script.
2.  Implement a Discord bot using libraries like `discord.py`.
3.  Define commands (e.g., start, stop, get logs) that interact with the keylogger.

**Note:** Ensure compliance with Discord's terms of service and guidelines when creating bots.
